I'm Colin Fike, a software engineer currently residing in San Francisco, CA. Most recently a backend engineer at Dictionary.com working with Nodejs daily but I also use Ruby, Python, Go, among others. I can help manage AWS infrastructure and CDN configuration (VCL is pretty cool stuff). I am looking for backend focused work.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/colinfike)
for some projects I've worked on. 

[YougoPremium](https://github.com/colinfike/yougo-premium) Command line tool written in Go used to subscribe to Youtube channels and download latest videos since the last download to your local machine for offline playback.

[JudgeGo](https://github.com/colinfike/judgego) Personal Discord bot written in Go with functionality to create sound clips from youtube videos, sound clip playback via voice channels, markov chain and sentence generation from user message history, and minor moderation functionality.

[Mimic](https://github.com/colinfike/mimic) Small Go package to enable training of Markov Chains based on text input and subsequent generation of sentences based on the training set.
