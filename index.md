I'm Colin Fike, a software engineer currently residing in San Francisco, CA. Graduated from the University at Buffalo
with a bachelors in Computer Science in 2014. I am a backend engineer at Dictionary.com working with Nodejs daily at the moment but also use Ruby, Python, Go, among others. I cut my teeth doing proper full stack with Rails/Django. 

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/colinfike)
