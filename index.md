I'm Colin Fike, a software engineer currently residing in San Francisco, CA. Graduated from the University at Buffalo
with a bachelors in Computer Science in 2014. Have mainly been working as a Fullstack Engineer since then using Ruby on Rails and Django, among other languages/technologies.

I tend to gravitate more to the backend side of things but enjoy the freedom
of being full stack and being able to take care of all parts of a project.
Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/colinfike)
for some projects I've worked on. 

[MegaModBot](https://github.com/colinfike/mega-mod-bot) - A Discord bot with multiple features to assist administrators with managing servers including word filters, image filtering, youtube audio ripping and playback, modular command implementation, and triggers. (WIP)
