I'm Colin Fike, a software developer based out of Buffalo who is planning to
move out west to the Bay Area in April (may be there already if I forget to
update this!). Graduated from the University at Buffalo with a bachelors in
Computer Science in 2014. Been cutting my teeth with Ruby and Rails and all
the tech/languages that come with that at
[Mainstreet Computing](https://mainstreetcomputing.com/) since I
graduated.

I tend to gravitate more to the backend side of things but enjoy the freedom
of being full stack and being able to take care of all parts of projects.
Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/colinfike)
for some projects I've worked on, some of them are up on AWS such
as [Markovky](https://markovky.com).

Feel free to check out my [resume](/ColinFikeResume.pdf) if you'd like to know a bit more about me or
any of the links below.
