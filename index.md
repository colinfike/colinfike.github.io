I'm Colin Fike, a software developer based out of Buffalo who is planning to
move out west to the Bay Area in April. Graduated from the University at Buffalo
with a bachelors in Computer Science in 2014. Been cutting my teeth with Ruby
and Rails and all the tech/languages that come with that at
[Mainstreet Computing](https://mainstreetcomputing.com/) since I
graduated.

I tend to gravitate more to the backend side of things but enjoy the freedom
of being full stack and being able to take care of all parts of a project.
Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/colinfike)
for some projects I've worked on, some of them are up on AWS such
as:

[Ploosic](https://ploosic.com/playlists/1) - Store and play SoundCloud/YouTube tracks on the same playlist with a single player

[Markovky](https://markovky.com) - Generate sentences using a markov chain created from a user's tweets
