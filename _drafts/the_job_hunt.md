Notes
1) Networking still king
2) either be an ace or have experience
3) Prepare for interviewers who may not understand what they are telling you
4) Steer clear of recruiters
5) Startsup aren't what you maybe expect
6) Big companies are black holes (not always great)
7) Focus on your best skill as main focus but companies are still willing to hire otherwise

Outline
1) Why I want to move to SF
2) Preparation
3) Method for applying and finding interesting companies and managing that
4) Responses from all stages
5) How did the technicals go?
6) Offers?
7) What did I go with? Did I find SOMETHING?
8) Whats next?
9) Suggestions for others / resources

Notes
1) Maybe do some metrics on time for response vs company size
2) Maybe talk about which companies wanted technicals, which ones did projects, which ones did X or Y?
3) Cover letter, no cover letter?
